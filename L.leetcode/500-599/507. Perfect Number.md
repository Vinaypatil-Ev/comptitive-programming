# 507.[Perfect Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-in-string/)

A [**perfect number**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_number) is a **positive integer** that is equal to the sum of its  **positive divisors** , excluding the number itself. A **divisor** of an integer `x` is an integer that can divide `x` evenly.

### 1.O(n)

use for loop from 1 to number - 1 and add it divisor

### 2.O(sqrt(n))

In this approach we divide the no upto sqrt(n)

If we look carefully, all the divisors are present in pairs. For example if n = 100, then the various pairs of divisors are: (1,100), (2,50), (4,25), (5,20), (10,10)
Using this fact we could speed up our program significantly.
We, however, have to be careful if there are two equal divisors as in the case of (10, 10). In such case, we have to include only one divisor.

```py
class Solution:
    def checkPerfectNumber(self, num: int) -> bool:
        if num == 1:
            return False
        sum_ = 1
        i = 2
        while i * i <= num:
            if num % i == 0:
                if num // i == i:
                    sum_ += i
                else:
                    sum_ += i
                    sum_ += num // i
            i += 1
        return sum_ == num
```

Space complexity - `O(sqrt(N))`
space complexity - `O(N)`
